## Abstract
The Colorado River is a lifeline for the American Southwest, supporting over 5.5 million irrigated acres of agricultural land and a population of 40 million people. The state of Colorado’s West Slope Basins - six subbasins of the Colorado River that lie on the western side of the continental divide - are critical headwaters of the Colorado River, delivering over 60% of inflows to the Lower Basin in an average year. The West Slope basins also play a vital role in supporting the state of Colorado’s local economy and natural environment. Agricultural production and recreational activities supported by water resources within the West Slope Basins are estimated to contribute over $6 billion annually to the state’s economy. Streamflow in the West Slope Basins sustains populations of endangered fish not found outside the Colorado River Basin. Balancing the multisectoral water demands in the West Slope Basins is an increasing challenge for water managers. Droughts in the 20th and early 21st centuries reduced reservoir levels, lowered environmental flows, and threatened agricultural production. Internal variability - irreducible uncertainty stemming from interactions across non-linear processes within the hydroclimate system - complicates future vulnerability assessment. The historical streamflow record in the West Slope represents a single realization of an inherently stochastic process, which does not capture the full extent of internal variability. Climate change further complicates drought vulnerability assessment - downscaled climate modeling suggests the potential for significant declines in West Slope streamflows by mid-century.   

This work contributes a detailed analysis of multisectoral drought vulnerability in the West Slope Basins, incorporating internal variability and climate change. We first develop a novel multi-site Hidden Markov Model (HMM) synthetic streamflow generator that captures the internal variability of streamflows across the six West Slope basins. We then route an ensemble of streamflows generated by the HMM generator through StateMod, the state of Colorado’s water model, to evaluate spatially compounding drought impacts across the West Slope Basins. To assess the effects of climate change, we perturb the HMM to generate a climate-adjusted ensemble of streamflows that reflects plausible changes in climate, and evaluate multisectoral impacts using StateMod. Our results show that drought events emerging from the system’s internal variability can have impacts that exceed extreme conditions in the historical record, including unprecedented lows in deliveries to the lower basin, environmental flows, reservoir levels, and agricultural demand satisfaction. Our results further illustrate that plausible climate changes can cause extreme drought impacts observed in the historical record to become routine. These results can inform future Colorado River planning efforts, and our methodology is globally applicable to snow-dominated regions with conflicting multisectoral water demand.

These are generated by Zenodo automatically when conducting a release when Zenodo has been linked to your GitHub repository. The Zenodo references are built by setting the author order in order of contribution to the code using the author's GitHub user name.  This citation can, and likely should, be edited without altering the DOI.

If you have modified a codebase that is outside of a formal release, and the modifications are not planned on being merged back into a version, fork the parent repository and add a `.<shortname>` to the version number of the parent and construct your own name.  For example, `v1.2.5.hydro`.

## Reproduce my experiment
This experiment has two main phases. First, the multi-site HMM is fit to the historical record of streamflows in the West Slope Basins. This can be done locally on a laptop or desktop. Second, the streamflow ensembles are run through StateMod and output is collected and compressed. This step must be done on an HPC resource. This experiment was conducted on [The Cube](https://www.cac.cornell.edu/wiki/index.php?title=THECUBE_Cluster) and [Hopper](https://www.cac.cornell.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Hopper_Cluster) clusters at Cornell University.

### 1. Fit the multi-site HMM and generate synthetic streamflow ensembles
| Script Name | Description | How to Run |
